# Valentuna-IPRemote
An android IP camera remote controller.
* *Same as the other application but with a different approach.*
* I use Java in here instead of C# *(Since I have difficulty finding resources in C#. Sorry Hunny!)*

### Requirements:
* Android Studio (You can still use java in Visual Studio. You can add java support [**here**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=georgewfraser.vscode-javac))
* An android device (If you have the confidence to use a Xamarin Forms for cross-platform. I support you!)
* A router
* PPoE Ethernet switch (If your router has a PPoE. Condragulations! You can ignore this one.)
* IP Camera (The star)
* **Optional**: A minimum of API 21 Android Lollipop (You can modify it from the minimum target framwork of solution settings)
* Peace of mind (Required)
* And internet connection (if the project throws an error and your anxiety levels climbs up)
* Good playlist
* A complete sleep
